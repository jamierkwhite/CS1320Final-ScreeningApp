Instructions to run:
* Backend: no startup needed as it's deployed
* Frontend: First, create a new NativeScript playground. Then within this repository, go to HeartDiseaseScreeingApp/app/ and then upload all the files in the components directory to the app/components folder on NS playground, upload all the files in the images directory to a app/images folder on NS playground, and replace the app.js and app.css files in NS playground with the ones in this directory. Save this and scan the QR code on the NativeScript playground app on your phone to open RHDScreen in NativeScript preview.
